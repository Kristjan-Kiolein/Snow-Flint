/**
 * <b>Problem 96</b>
 * <br><br>
 * Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept.
 * Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar,
 * and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles,
 * however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column,
 * and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting
 * puzzle grid and its solution grid.
 *<br><br>
 *<pre>
 * 0 0 3   0 0 8   0 0 2			4 8 3   5 4 8   3 7 2<br>   
 * 9 0 0   7 0 0   8 0 0			9 6 7   7 2 9   8 1 4<br>    
 * 0 0 1   0 0 6   0 0 5			2 5 1   1 3 6   6 9 5<br> 
 * 		    	       	 			                     <br>
 * 0 2 0   1 0 2   6 0 9			9 2 1   1 3 2   6 8 9<br>
 * 3 0 5   0 0 0   2 0 3			3 4 5   5 6 4   2 5 3<br>
 * 8 0 6   7 0 8   0 1 0			8 7 6   7 9 8   4 1 7<br>
 * 		    	       	 			                     <br>
 * 6 0 0   9 0 0   5 0 0			6 5 7   9 7 6   5 1 4<br>
 * 0 0 1   0 0 8   0 0 9			8 2 1   1 3 8   7 6 9<br>
 * 4 0 0   2 0 0   3 0 0			4 9 3   2 4 5   3 8 2<br>
 *</pre>
 *<br>
 * A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be
 * necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this).
 * The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle;
 * the example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.
 * <br><br>
 * The 6K text file, sudoku.txt contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty,
 * but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).
 * <br><br>
 * <i>By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid;
 * for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.</i>
